Hello!! My name is Ven!! [He / It / PK / Pup / She + Xenos]!!

I'm 17 and a Senior in highschool! I'm a writer, cosplayer, and artist,, I really like One Piece, Earthbound, PJSK, Pokemon, HSR, and like TOOONNNSS more!! I am also a yumeshipper n' fictionkin!!

I'm usually afk or offtab on Ponytown, and I try to interact with people when I can , but I ca be socially awkward. If I dont respond to you, please don't take it personally!! I'm bad at knowing how to respond to people, and even then, I usually don't see when people try to talk to me.

If you want to see my extended interests, my byi, and my dni, please go look at my strawpage!! I will state here that I am anti-censorship and my ideals may coinside with those of the 'proshipping' movement. If that makes you uncomfortable, please don't make yourself interact with me!!

I swear I'm super awesome and not scary at all!!
